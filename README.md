# BCNF decompostion algorithm
This is a project implementing BCNF decompostion algorithm in Java.
Given a relation R and functional dependency FD, the program should 
return the decomposed RF pair that has no BCNF violation.

The example input has the format:

A B C D E
A B -> C
C -> D
D -> B E

The output should has the same format.
